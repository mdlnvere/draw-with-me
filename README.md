# draw-with-me

## Description
An interactive Processing sketch that lets you draw by moving your mouse. The program follows your mouse movements and creates smooth, fluid lines in real time. You can pause and resume the drawing with keyboard input, making it a fun and dynamic creative tool.

## Features
- Real-time drawing that follows your mouse movements.
- Smooth, fluid line rendering for natural strokes.
- Toggle drawing on/off using the spacebar.
- Multiple colors and stroke dynamics (can be added/extended).

## How to Use
1. Run the sketch in Processing.
2. Move your mouse on the canvas to draw.
3. Press the spacebar to pause/resume drawing.
4. Close the window to end the program.

## Tech Stack
- Processing (Java-based creative coding framework)

## Purpose
This project is designed to explore interactive drawing techniques and user input in Processing. Itâ€™s perfect for artists and developers interested in dynamic, user-driven generative art.
