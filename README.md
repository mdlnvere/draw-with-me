# draw-with-me

**draw-with-me** is an interactive drawing project built with Processing that lets you create art by moving your mouse.

## Overview

This sketch tracks your mouse movements in real-time and draws smooth, flowing lines following the cursor. Itâ€™s a simple but expressive tool to visualize your gestures as generative art.

## Features

- Draw continuously by moving your mouse across the canvas.
- Smooth lines created using curve vertices for a natural look.
- Drawing starts automatically and follows the mouse position.
- Click or interact with the canvas to reset or add effects (optional, depending on implementation).

## Contribution

Feel free to fork the project and experiment by adding new features like color changes, pressure simulation, or brush effects.
